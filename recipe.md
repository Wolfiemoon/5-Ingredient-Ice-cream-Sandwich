You hardly need a real recipe for this beauty, since there's nothing to measure. Instead, just assemble and freeze!

First, place 12 ice cream sandwiches in the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch dish.

An ice cream sandwich cake is easy to assemble in just 10 minutes!

You will need to cut the last ice cream sandwich in half in order to get it to fit in the pan. Trust me -- this doesn't have to be perfect (it will still taste amazing)!

Use two layers of ice cream sandwiches for this 5 ingredient ice cream sandwich cake

Allow the ice cream sandwiches to soften a bit, and then use the back of a spoon (or your fingers) to gently press them down a little bit.

Top the ice cream sandwiches with a layer of whipped topping, drizzle with chocolate and caramel syrups, and sprinkle with toppings of choice (I used mini M&M's here).

Repeat the layers once more, and you're done! Just pop the Ice Cream Sandwich Cake into your freezer to firm up before slicing and serving.

This simple no-bake dessert is so easy that you truly cannot mess it up!

Stephanie offered a few different suggestions for flavor variations, so I thought I'd share those ideas as well. Have fun with your toppings!

VARIATIONS -- ICE CREAM SANDWICH CAKE:
Try different flavors of ice cream sandwiches. In addition to the standard chocolate and vanilla, stores now sell Cookies & Cream ice cream sandwiches, Salted Caramel ice cream sandwiches, and Neopolitan ice cream sandwiches.
Use different syrups, such as a strawberry ice cream syrup for a fruity twist!
Mix up the toppings. I used mini M&M's (which are a favorite at my house), but Stephanie also suggested coarsely crushed Oreos, Heath toffee bits, or chocolate chips. Stephanie's friend even used crushed waffle cones and chopped peanuts so that the Ice Cream Sandwich Cake would taste like a Drumstick cone! Love that idea.
Garnish with different colored sprinkles to match the upcoming holidays. For instance, one reader suggested using red, white and blue sprinkles for Memorial Day or July 4th!

I have no doubt that any combination you choose will be absolutely AH-MAZING!
